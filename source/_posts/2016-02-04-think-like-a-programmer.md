Think like a Programmer: Blog Post


	Programming is an incredibly complex but rewarding activity. It forces users to step outside of their comfort zone, learn new and possibly challenging languages, and implement problem solving skills. Programming is rife with challenges, obstacles, and barriers that can make life difficult for the programmer and cause some people to lose their motivation or their focus. Programming is not easy – and that is why certain mindsets, traits, and skills are essential to molding a user into the best programmer that he/she can be. 
	In the articles by Maria Popova and Allison Kaptur, two mentalities are described. There is the fixed mentality, in which one is unable to move past predetermined notions and ideas of their skills or self-worth, and there is the growth mentality, in which one is able to evolve and adapt to different problems and situations. The fixed mentality can make a programmer rigid and unwilling to take risks while the growth mentality opens one up to new experiences and challenges that can help them grow as a programmer. Obviously, the growth mentality is desirable in this case and yields the greatest benefit to the user. 
	In another by John Rampton, 15 characteristics are described that, in conjunction with one another, allow someone to be the best programmer possible. Some are fairly technical such as “impressive technical skills” and “debugging skills,” however others are targeted towards a programmer’s mindset such as “passion for the work,” “grace under fire,” and “ability to handle failure.” Similar to the growth mentality, each of these traits are skills that can benefit a programmer by making him/her more open to challenges, more willing to overcome obstacles when they are in the way, and more interested and passionate about the work that they are doing. 
	Though programming can be difficult, time consuming, and arduous, thinking like a programmer is the first step towards achieving one’s maximum potential. It is essential that anyone interested in computer science try to learn and practice these skills in order to achieve the highest degree of expertise in the field.
