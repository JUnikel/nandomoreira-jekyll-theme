Successful languages: Blog Post


	There is no doubt that learning to program is an incredibly complex and unique process. To learn a language, one must cover the basics of syntax, structure, and general commands. Then come the intricacies of each language, specific commands used only for certain purposes and different types of organization. It can take years to truly master a language. Yet, as computer science has grown more popular and as technology has grown to accommodate each person’s specific needs, a plethora of languages have surfaced, providing new ways to interact with computers and create digital content. So why is it that certain languages succeed and others fail? In other words, how have languages like C++, Java, and Python grown to become staples of the industry while others remain overshadowed?
	One of the largest issues when it comes to new languages is familiarity. As Neil McAllister states in his article, “Why new programming languages succeed or fail”, that “Few developers want to relearn the basics from scratch… That means new languages should be at least a little C-like.” Though some languages, like Python, have grown even though they are dissimilar to C, yet each popular language possesses some form of object orientation that is familiar and accessible to everyone with experience in programming. 
	Second, successful languages are open-source. This means that the code is easily distributable and revisable by anyone who chooses to use the language. Developers find this useful in that the language can be improved or modified by anyone with the ability to do so. 
	Finally, as stated by McAllister, “successful languages have a niche.” Languages like Ruby, Perl, and C# each have their own place in the programming world. This makes them unique and incredibly important in their respective fields. Of course, certain languages like Java have found their place as an all purpose tool, however those are fewer and farther in between.
